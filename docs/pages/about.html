      <p>Marc Shapiro and Billy Corbett are a new-old-time duo rooted in the hills of Vermont and New Hampshire.
      Marc and Billy forage from a collection of traditional and newer tunes and stews them in a broth of bluegrass and folk. </p>

      <p>Building on a friendship that began many years ago, Marc Shapiro (banjo, guitar, vocals) and Billy Corbett (mandolin, guitar, vocals) quickly established themselves on the New Hampshire and Vermont music scenes, playing listening rooms, farmers markets, weddings, radio shows and bluegrass festivals. </p>

      <p>In 2015, Marc and Billy turned to Kickstarter to raise money to produce their first record, <a href="http://etnaoldtime.bandcamp.com"><b>'Lo the Old Pine</b></a>, released in January 2016. </p>
