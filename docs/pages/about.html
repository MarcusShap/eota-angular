      <p>Marc Shapiro and Billy Corbett are a new-old-time duo rooted in the hills of Vermont and New Hampshire.
      Marc and Billy forage from a collection of newer tunes and traditional tunes and stew them in a broth of bluegrass and folk. </p>

      <p>Building on a friendship that began many years ago, Marc (banjo, guitar, vocals) and Billy (mandolin, guitar, vocals) established themselves in the New England music scene playing listening rooms, festivals, and bars.</p>
